== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin right from your WordPress admin in plugins > Add New. 
1-bis. Download the plugin, unzip the package and upload it to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin
3. Go to Appearance -> Customize and you'll see the "Childify Me" button. 
3-bis. In Appearance -> Themes, hover on a non-child theme and click on Live Preview, once there you'll see the "Childify Me" button

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm in Appearance -> Customize but I cannot find the "Childify Me" button, why? =

Is your theme a non-child theme? Childify Me is designed to make child themes only for non-child themes.

= I created a child theme from Preview, but when I back to Appearance -> Themes I cannot see it, why? =

Please, refresh the page.

= How can I create a child-theme in multisite? =

Go to Appearance -> Customize (or to Appearance -> Themes, if you want to create a child-theme of a
non-active theme, hover on a non-child theme and click on Live Preview)

= I created a child-theme but I lost my menu, how so? =

This is because some options aren't really part of the theme options.
Basically you can consider them as options related to theme. Wordpress saves them in a different db row of the wp-options table.
From the Codex: http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

**Note:** You may need to re-save your menu (Appearance > Menus, or Appearance > Customize > Menus) and theme options 
(including background and header images) after activating the child theme. 

= Why my child-theme's screenshot doesn't have the ribbon? =

That feature is implemented using some functions of the PHP GD module.
So you need a PHP version >= 4.0 and the GD module installed and loaded.

= Why for some themes the child-theme style.css uses the @import directive ? =
